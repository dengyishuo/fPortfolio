rollingWindows <-

{
    # A function implemented by Rmetrics
    # modified by Yohan Chalabi 2008-02-18

    # Description:
    #   Returns vectors of start and end dates for a rolling time series

    # Arguments:
    #   x - a timeSeries object of asset returns
    #   period - a character string denoting the length of the rolling
    #       window, e.g. "24m" means 24 months
    #   by - a character string denoting the shift of the rolling window,
    #       e.g. "1m" means one month

    # Note:
    #   Only "monthly" frequencies are currently supported.

    # Example:
    #   x = sort(as.timeSeries(data(smallcap.ts))); rollingWindows(x)

    # FUNCTION:

    # Get Window Parameter:
    periodLength = as.numeric(substr(period, 1, nchar(period)-1))

    byUnit = substr(by, nchar(by), nchar(by))
    stopifnot(periodUnit == "m")
    stopifnot(byUnit == "m")

    # Make Windows - expand series x to a monthly series:
    positions = time(x)

    # for non monthly data
    # series(startPositions)[1] <- as.vector(start(x))
    endPositions = unique(timeLastDayInMonth(positions))
